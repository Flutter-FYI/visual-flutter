# Mobile + Visual + Learner

Hello, and welcome to #VisualFlutter. I jumpstarted this initiative in March 2021 (during [#FlutterEngage](https://events.flutter.dev/engage/schedule)) with two goals in mind:

 * **Deconstruct Mobile App Development.** The mobile ecosystem is incredibly fractured, with numerous platforms, languages, concepts and challenges. I wanted to maintain a living document that would support learning journeys for beginners and experienced devs alike, as they navigate the ecosystem, tools, technologies and community. The goal is to describe _general concepts_ (for breadth) and then showcase _implementation_ using Flutter (for depth).

 * **Support Visual Learners' Journeys.** When it comes to learning something new, we all have different ways of doing it. We read/write (articles), listen (lectures) and do hands-on activities (kinesthetic). And 65% of us are _visual_ learners - we use visual and spatial information to grasp the "big picture", detect or discover "patterns" and then "connect the dots" to things we've learned before. Spatio-visual resources help us understand, retain, and recall, information better!

Want to get a sense of what I mean? Check out my [SketchTheDocs](https://twitter.com/sketchthedocs) account to explore other visual guides to tech and career development. 

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses the [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) site generator with the [docsify-themeable](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/docsify-themeable/#/) system for customization. I am keenly interested in rethinking _documentation_ from a learner perspective so expect experimentation with themes and plugins as I build up content!

And now .. let's get learning!
